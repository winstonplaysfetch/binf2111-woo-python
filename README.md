# binf2111-woo-python
Python scripts for Bioinformatics 2111. 

Notable scripts are 23andmeblueeyes.py and DNATranslationDict.py. Most other scripts are short exercises.

Its been long enough now, and the class has changed professors at least once, that I'm almost certain I can post this coursework and not sacrifice anyone's integrity. 

There's a table of scripts with assignment descriptions. 

The .zip files should be stand alone, they should be just "# python script.py" and go. 

Samples folder contains all data files used in the scripts.
